# ParabolicIllusionGA

Project for Computational Geometry involving creating illusion with basic principe of linear interpolation and stacking triangles.

## Realized Project Output

The images below shows the static output of the main geometric figure generated by the GCLC code.

## Parameters 

You can adjust your parameters in the code if you want to have different kind of illusions (more or less dense etc)...

- **side:**  from point A to Point B how large is one of the side of the triangles.
- **steps:** How many times will interpolation be used, in common phrase is how many times will triangles be spiralling.
- **shrink:** interpolation factor of the formula.
